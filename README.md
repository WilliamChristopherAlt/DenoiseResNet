This project implemented a full pipeline to train a ResNet model to perform images denoising tasks, the model takes in a 128x128 patch of image and returns a denoised version of it. Multiple overlapping patches of the image can then be processed by the model and average together to perform denoising for the whole image.

To run this pipeline, you must first create a folder named "images" on your workspace, and another folder named "data", then fill in the images folder with pictures of your choice, then you are good to go.
